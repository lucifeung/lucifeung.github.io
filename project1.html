               <h3> Project 1</h3>
      		<p>
      		For project 1, I wanted to create cute figures that could be drawn.  For my different brushes, they change by pressing keys 1 through 5.  Brush 1 draws a bear.  Brush 2 draws a flower, brush 3 draws a heart, brush 4 draws a bunny, and brush 5 draws a dog.  If the "x" key is pressed, the screen is reset to white.  Each brush is made with functions with arguments.  Using the keyPressed function, the brushes make continuous lines, making small drawings.  In the beginning, I was having a difficult time working with fuctions with arguments, but eventually I got the hang of it, and I was able to incorporate them successfully into this project.  Improvemnent could be made on making more variety of the brushes.  I should have done more to make modifications, like scaling or changing the tint.  However, I am still extremely happy with how the project turned out.  The art style that would most likely be suited by these brushes would be more of a cutesy, cartoony, animated style as well as a more abstract line style created by the overlap of the figures.  <br>
